# Air Booking Analysis

Based in the United States, Airbnb is an online marketplace for lodging, mostly homestays for vacation rentals. Airbnb does not really own any of the properties listed; rather, it receives payment from booking commissions. Airbnb is a database of hotel reservations. Only the years 2011 through 2019 for New York City are covered by this data.
## Steps Invovled for EDA

1. Data Wrangling
2. Performed Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
3. Checked correlation between each features
4. Treatment of Null values
5. Treatment of Outliers
6. Explored Visualization
7. Transformation
8. Statistical Test
## Asking Question to Ourself

Asking Question to Explore the data insights

1. What can we learn about different hosts and areas?

    i) How many number of hosts which has availability of 365 days i.e 24x7

    ii) Which host has the highest number of reviews?

    iii) Which host has the highest number of reviews per month?

    iv) Which is the most expensive area and show the price distribution?


2. What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)

    i) What can we learn from Locations and Prices?

    ii) What can we learn from Locations and Reviews?


3. Which hosts are the busiest and why?

    i) why the above host has a highest bookings count?

4. Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

We prepared other questions as well in order to fully comprehend the data. To enhance better understanding, you can look at our Notebook.

***All of these insights will be obtained through EDA and a thorough comprehension of the
data.***
## Exploratory Data Analysis and Notebook

We looked into the question and gained a better understanding of it. After understanding, we examined into several styles of data visualisation and charts to plot in an exciting way and quickly pick up knowledge from the plotting.
